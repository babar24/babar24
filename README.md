### Steps to create latex based resume

1. I have used Jake Ryan overleaf template. So login to https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs website.
2. Remove all the existing content of this template with the uploaded main.tex file here on my github.
3. Please update your email properly. Many people have missed updating email correctly due to which I have received many invites.
4. Re-compile the content that you replaced with main.tex file on overleaf website.
5. Whoa! You got resume just like mine. Now update as per your choice.
